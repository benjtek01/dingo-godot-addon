<hr/>
 
- Dynamic and static modes for door placement - generate doors randomly located within a room, or in a specific location within the room (good for irregularly shaped rooms & prebuilt rooms)

<hr/>

- Options to guarantee room amounts or set “goal” amounts (good for if you want more rigid or dynamic layouts)

- This is my first Godot addon i've published, so please let me know if you have any critiques or suggestions, I would like to create more addons in the future so I appreciate the feedback

- If you do end up using this plugin, I would be very interested in seeing what you create! Feel free to show me your results in your game or any other projects by contacting me through any of the socials I have linked. I look forward to seeing what the community can create with this tool and how it can be improved

# Contribution 
If you would like to make changes please send in a feature proposal or bug report prior to commiting any work or sending PRs! If you would like to implement any listed "future plans" feel free to have a go with it or implementing anything else you think would be helpful for this addon.

# Known Issues/Limitations
- Corridors can only be of one room type 
- No seed creation 
- Large scenes with lots of rooms can crash Godot when the project is opened (to fix this if it occurs, prevent the scene from opening upon startup in Projects → Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene)

# Future Plans 
- Seed creation
- Multiple corridor roomtypes
- Faster mesh building
- LODs
- Customizable corner tiles for room types
- Minimap creation
